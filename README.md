Fast Fourier Transform for predictive manteinance thru vibrations.
The motor used on the test is a 1320 RPM so this is 22Hz so the result of the FFT only with so few samples 256 in one second is quite good.
As you can see on this video

I have used this example to modify the code supplied by Lilygo
